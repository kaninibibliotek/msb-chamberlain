# Only start this service after the httpd user process has started
start on started httpd-user

# Stop the service gracefully if the runlevel changes to 'reboot'
stop on runlevel [06]

# Run the scripts as the 'http' user. Running as root (the default) is a bad idea.
setuid http

# Restart on crash
respawn

# Exec the process. Use fully formed path names so that there is no reliance on $PATH
# the 'www' file is a node.js script which starts the foobar application.
exec /usr/local/bin/node /volume1/git/msb-chamberlain
